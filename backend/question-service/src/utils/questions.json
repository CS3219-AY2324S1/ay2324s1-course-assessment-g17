The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.\n\nRoman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n\nI can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.\nX can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.\nC can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and\ndriver_id are foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table.\nStatus is an ENUM (category) type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver',\n'cancelled_by_client').\n\n\nTable: Users\n\n+-------------+----------+\n| Column Name | Type |\n+-------------+----------+\n| users_id | int |\n| banned | enum |\n| role | enum |\n+-------------+----------+\nusers_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.\nThe table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an\nENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').\nbanned is an ENUM (category) type of ('Yes', 'No').\n\nThe cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by\nclient or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of\nrequests with unbanned users on that day.\n\nWrite a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned\nusers (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between \"2013-\n10-01\" and \"2013-10-03\". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.\n\nReturn the result table in any order.\n\nThe result format is in the following example.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nTrips table:\n+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+\n| id | client_id | driver_id | city_id | status | request_at |\n+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+\n| 1 | 1 | 10 | 1 | completed | 2013-10-01 |\n| 2 | 2 | 11 | 1 | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |\n| 3 | 3 | 12 | 6 | completed | 2013-10-01 |\n| 4 | 4 | 13 | 6 | cancelled_by_client | 2013-10-01 |\n| 5 | 1 | 10 | 1 | completed | 2013-10-02 |\n| 6 | 2 | 11 | 6 | completed | 2013-10-02 |\n| 7 | 3 | 12 | 6 | completed | 2013-10-02 |\n| 8 | 2 | 12 | 12 | completed | 2013-10-03 |\n| 9 | 3 | 10 | 12 | completed | 2013-10-03 |\n| 10 | 4 | 13 | 12 | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-03 |\n+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+\nUsers table:\n+----------+--------+--------+\n| users_id | banned | role |\n+----------+--------+--------+\n| 1 | No | client |\n| 2 | Yes | client |\n| 3 | No | client |\n| 4 | No | client |\n| 10 | No | driver |\n| 11 | No | driver |\n| 12 | No | driver |\n| 13 | No | driver |\n+----------+--------+--------+\nOutput:\n+------------+-------------------+\n| Day | Cancellation Rate |\n+------------+-------------------+\n| 2013-10-01 | 0.33 |\n| 2013-10-02 | 0.00 |\n| 2013-10-03 | 0.50 |\n+------------+-------------------+\nExplanation:\nOn 2013-10-01:\n- There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.\n- However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2),\nso it is ignored in the calculation.\n- Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n- The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33\nOn 2013-10-02:\n- There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n- The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n- Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n- The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00\nOn 2013-10-03:\n- There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n- The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n- Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.\n- The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50"
